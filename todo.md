i think some next things for me beyond testing differently-lengthed videos is

• getting my mind around Leaflet coordinate system, set video location + size via data.json
• test with more videos - do renamed copies
• getting that cross browser package thing into here, start testing in chrome
• plop this demo into a create-react-app, deploy to netlify
• add method for interacting with on vs off screen video
